# Roadmap

1. Add support for CVars
2. Add support for different colors
3. Add in-game console support
4. Re-factor because it'll probably be sad by the time I'm done
5. Figure out a way to alert the user when a CVar is already register
   but the user is attempting to assign a new value
   - Maybe a "readonly" bool on the CVar?
